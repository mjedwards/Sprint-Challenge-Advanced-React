- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

  class components allow us to have access to specific methods like didMount or didUpdate. This type control allows the developer to have a better contorl of state, giving them the freedom to manage and display data as needed

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

  componentDidMount - this is where state is set, componentDidUpdate - this is where state can be updated, componentWillUnmount - this is where state is removed.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

  Allows us to utilize logic in our state hooks with ease. It allows for reusable code, keeping us DRY.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?


    it provides protection against poorly written code, allows for the development of efficient code, bugs can be caught faster, allows for trust in code
